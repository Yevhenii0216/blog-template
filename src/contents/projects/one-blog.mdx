I tried to make an online blog where users could write their own posts with a rich text editor. It's a big challenge because I'm not familiar with databases. I'm using Prisma to connect to the database. I refer to many projects when I build this website such as [prisma/fullstack-prisma-nextjs-blog](https://github.com/prisma/fullstack-prisma-nextjs-blog).
