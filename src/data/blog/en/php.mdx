## Introduction of PHP

PHP (full name: PHP: _Hypertext Preprocessor_) is an open source general-purpose computer scripting language, especially suitable for web development and embedded in HTML. The syntax of PHP draws on the characteristics of popular computer languages such as C language, Java and Perl, and is easy for general programmers to learn. The main goal of PHP is to allow web developers to quickly write dynamic pages, but PHP is also used in many other areas.

The PHP file extension is `.php`, E.g `index.php`. As mentioned above, `PHP` can directly embed `HTML`.

## Usage

When the browser reads `<?php` from top to bottom, it executes `PHP` and ends with `?>`. Such as:

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>PHP</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <?php
            echo "This is a sentence."
        ?>
    </body>
</html>`}
</Pre>

## Precautions

In `PHP`, there is no other `HTML` after the `PHP` directive is completed. It is recommended not to end with `?>`. It will cause trouble if it is closed.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    echo "No HTML after PHP ends";
`}
</Pre>

## PHP comments

Almost most web programming languages can comment, and the **single-line** way of `PHP` is `//` and the **multi-line** way is `/* Some text here */`.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    echo = "This is a single line comment"; // I am a single line comment
    echo = "This is a multi-line comment";
    /*
        I am a multi-line comment
        Second line
    */
?>`}
</Pre>

## Echo

The simplest syntax in `PHP` is `Echo`. The content of `Echo` must be enclosed in double quotes `""` or single quotes `''`. Each syntax must end with a semicolon `;`.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    echo "This is the example of using double quotes.";
    echo 'This is the example of using single quotes.';
?>`}
</Pre>

Content in `Echo` can also use `HTML` syntax. For example, I used `<br/>` here, so that the line can be broken.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    echo "This is the first sentence<br/>";
    echo "This is the second sentence";
    echo "<a href=\"https://example.com\">here is a link</a>";
?>`}
</Pre>

## Variable

We can assign a value to a variable to make it easier for us to write `PHP`, similar to `Javascript`. We will use the Dollar sign `$`.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    $value = "I am a value";
?>`}
</Pre>

There are some rules to follow when we name variables.

| Example  | Description       | Rules |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| $value   | Lowercase         | ✅    |
| $Value   | Uppercase         | ✅    |
| $\_value | Underscore        | ✅    |
| $1value  | Start from number | ❌    |

There is a difference between `uppercase` and `lowercase` in variable names. Uppercase variables are not equal to lowercase variables.

## Variable Naming Tips

### Camel case

When a variable name and a function name are linked together by two or more words to form a unique identification word, the use of "camel case" to represent, can increase the readability of variables and functions. Because we can't have `spaces` in variables.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    $onePlusOneAnswer = 1 + 1;
    echo $onePlusOneAnswer;
?>`}
</Pre>

### Snake case

Snake case (like snake_case) refers to a writing style in which every space is replaced with an underscore ( \_ ) character and the first letter of every word is written in lowercase.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    $one_plus_one_answer = 1 + 1;
    echo $one_plus_one_answer;
?>`}
</Pre>

## String operator

There are two string operators. The first is the concatenation operator ("."), which returns the concatenated string of its left and right arguments. The second is the concatenation assignment operator (".="), which appends the right-hand argument to the left-hand argument.

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    echo "This" . " " . "is" . " " . "String" . " " . "operators" . ".";
?>`}
</Pre>

## Arithmetic operator

<Pre language='php'>
  {`<?php
    $value0 = 1.5 // Float
    $value1 = 1 + 1 // Plus
    $value2 = 1 - 1 // Minus
    $value3 = 1 * 1 // Times
    $value4 = 1 / 1 // Divide
    $value5 = 12 / 5 // Divide | Incomplete division will become float, which is different from other programming languages, php will calculate the remainder
    $value6 = 3 % 5 // take the remainder
?>`}
</Pre>
