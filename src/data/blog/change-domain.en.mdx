## Reason

The domain `tszhong.top` was purchased on `2021-05-10`. The first year was USD 1.19. Recently, I found that this domain is not easy to remember, so I thought of changing the domain. I googled `The best domain for personal website`. I looked at it for a while and thought `.me` should be suitable for me. Because the interpretation on [domain.me](https://domain.me/) is that `.me` represents a personal meaning:

> .ME is SEO-friendly
> .ME domains operate similar to traditional domains such as .com, .net and .org, and are ranked by Google in the same way.

And `Hong` is the one of the words in my name of [Yale romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_romanization)
