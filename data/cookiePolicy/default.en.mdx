## What are cookies on websites?

Cookies are small files of information that a web server generates and sends to a web browser. Web browsers store the cookies they receive for a predetermined period of time, or for the length of a user's session on a website. They attach the relevant cookies to any future requests the user makes of the web server.

Cookies help inform websites about the user, enabling the websites to personalize the user experience. For example, e-commerce websites use cookies to know what merchandise users have placed in their shopping carts. In addition, some cookies are necessary for security purposes, such as authentication cookies (see below).

The cookies that are used on the Internet are also called "HTTP cookies." Like much of the web, cookies are sent using the [HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).

## Where are cookies stored?

Web browsers store cookies in a designated file on users' devices. The Google Chrome web browser, for instance, stores all cookies in a file labeled "Cookies" Chrome users can view the cookies stored by the browser by [opening developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open), clicking the "Application" tab, and clicking on "Cookies" on the left side menu.

## What are the different types of cookies?

Some of the most important types of cookies to know include:

### Session cookies

A session cookie helps a website track a user's session. Session cookies are deleted after a user's session ends â€” once they log out of their account on a website or exit the website. Session cookies have no expiration date, which signifies to the browser that they should be deleted once the session is over.

### Persistent cookies

Unlike session cookies, persistent cookies remain in a user's browser for a predetermined length of time, which could be a day, a week, several months, or even years. Persistent cookies always contain an expiration date.

### Authentication cookies

Authentication cookies help manage user sessions; they are generated when a user logs into an account via their browser. They ensure that sensitive information is delivered to the correct user sessions by associating user account information with a cookie identifier string.

### Tracking cookies

Tracking cookies are generated by tracking services. They record user activity, and browsers send this record to the associated tracking service the next time they load a website that uses that tracking service.

### Zombie cookies

Like the "zombies" of popular fiction, zombie cookies regenerate after they are deleted. Zombie cookies create backup versions of themselves outside a browser's typical cookie storage location. They use these backups to reappear within a browser after they are deleted. Zombie cookies are sometimes used by unscrupulous ad networks, and even by cyberattackers.

## How to clear cookies?

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 'settings' preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information. Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management in their products.
